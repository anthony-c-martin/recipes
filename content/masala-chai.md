## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups water
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 3 whole cloves
- 4 green cardamom pods, cracked open
- 4 black peppercorns
- 1/2 tsp fennel seeds (optional)
- 1/2" fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
- 3 black tea bags or sub 3 tsp loose leaf black tea
- 1 cup milk
- 4 tsp cane sugar

## Instructions

1. Heat a medium saucepan over high heat. Add water, cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, black peppercorns, fennel seeds (if using), and ginger. Bring to a boil and add the tea bags or leaves.
1. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently for 7-10 minutes, depending on how strong you’d like the tea and spices. It will turn a deep burgundy color and reduce slightly.
1. Add milk and sugar and stir. Raise the heat to high. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for another 5 minutes.
1. When ready to serve, raise the heat to high and allow it to come to a rolling boil for 1-2 minutes, depending on how 'cooked' you like the milk. If you’d like, use a ladle to aerate the chai to deepen the flavor and make it creamier.
1. Pour into cups through a strainer and add more sweetener, if desired.
