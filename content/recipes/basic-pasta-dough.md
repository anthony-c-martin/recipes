## Ingredients
* 420g all-purpose flour, sifted
* 4 large eggs
* 1 tbsp water
* 1 tsp salt

## Instructions
1. Break eggs into a glass measuring cup. Check to see that the eggs measure 7/8 cup (207 mL). If less than 7/8 cup (207 mL), add water, 1 tsp (2 mL) at a time, until measurement is reached.
1. Place flour and salt in Stand Mixer bowl. Attach bowl and flat beater. Turn to Speed 2 and gradually add eggs and 1 tbs (15 mL) water. Mix for 30 seconds. Stop the Stand Mixer and exchange the flat beater for the dough hook. Turn to Speed 2 and knead for 2 minutes.
1. Let dough rest for 20 minutes.
1. Remove mixture from bowl and place on a clean surface.
1. Dough may appear crumbly. Hand knead for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until dough is smooth, pliable and holds together in a ball.
