## Ingredients
* 8 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* 1 medium leek, white and pale green parts only, finely sliced (about 1/2 cup)
* 1 small onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
* 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced (about 2 teaspoons)
* 1 (2-inch) knob of ginger, peeled and finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1 to 2 tablespoons harissa paste (see notes)
* 2 1/2 pounds carrots, peeled and roughly chopped
* 1 1/2 quarts low-sodium homemade or store-bought vegetable or chicken broth (see notes)
* Kosher salt
* 1/4 cup pine nuts
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
* 1 tablespoon zest and 2 tablespoons juice from 1 lemon

## Instructions
1. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add leeks, onions, garlic, and ginger, and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add cumin, coriander, and harissa paste and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add carrots and stir to coat in spice mixture. Add broth (see note), season with a pinch of salt, bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until carrots are completely tender, about 20 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add pine nuts, reduce heat to low, and cook, tossing and stirring constantly, until fragrant and nutty brown, about 10 minute. Transfer to a bowl. Let cool for a few moments, then stir in parsley, lemon zest, and a pinch of salt.
1. When carrots are tender, transfer half of soup to a blender. Start blender on lowest speed and slowly increase speed to high. With blender running, slowly drizzle in remaining 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil. Transfer soup to a clean pot, pressing it through a fine mesh strainer or chinois if desired. Repeat with remaining soup and 2 more tablespoons olive oil. When all the soup is pur√©ed, season to taste with salt and whisk in lemon juice.
1. Serve soup immediately, topped with pine nut and parsley mixture.
