### For the Dal
* 1 tablespoon ghee
* 3 tablespoons salted butter divided
* 1 medium white onion 115 grams, finely grated using a food processor
* 2 teaspoons ginger garlic paste use fresh paste if possible
* 1/2 cup tomato puree use store bought tomato puree
* 1/2 teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder
* 1/4 teaspoon garam masala

* 1/2 teaspoon sugar

## Instructions

1. Wash and rinse urad dal (whole black lentil) and rajma (kidney beans) in a large bowl. Soak in 3 cups water overnight.
1. In the morning, drain the water in which the dal and rajma was soaked. Transfer the dal and rajma to a pressure cooker with 1 teaspoon salt. Add around 3.5 cups water. 
1. Add soaked lentil to a pan, add water and let it cook on medium heat for 1 hour & 15 minutes. It might take even longer. Once cooked, lentil should be really soft. The dal and rajma should be completely cooked and you should be able to mash them with your fingers. 
1. Mash some of the dal and rajma using a potato masher. Then turn on the heat to lowest heat and let the dal simmer while you make the masala.
1. To make the masala, in a large pot/pan, heat 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon ghee on medium heat.
1. Once the butter melts and is hot, add the finely grated onion. Cook the onion for around 6 to 7 minutes or until it turns light golden brown. Keep stirring it continuously so that it doesn't burn and keep heat on medium.
1. Add the ginger garlic paste and cook for 1 to 2 minute until the raw smell goes away.
1. Add the tomato puree and mix. Cook for 2 minutes or until the puree mixes well with masala and oil starts oozing out from the sides.
1. Add in the boiled dal (which had been simmering for around 10 to 15 mins you were making the masala) and mix. 
1. Add garam masala, kashmiri red chili powder and salt. Mix to combine. 
1. Add 1/2 cup water, stir and set heat to low. Let it simmer on low heat uncovered for around 45 minutes. 
1. Stir often (every 10 minutes or so) else dal will stick to the bottom of the pot. You will also need to add water. I added total of 1.5 cups water as the dal was simmering.
1. Add sugar and mix after the dal has simmered for 45 minutes.
1. Also add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and 1/4 cup cream. Mix well.
1. Simmer for 10 more minutes on low heat after adding the cream. Dal will become really creamy by now. You may serve the dal at this point.
1. Garnish dal makhani with more cream and serve with a pat of butter. Enjoy!
