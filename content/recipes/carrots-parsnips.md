description: Roast carrots & parsnips
---

Root vegetables respond very well to a little extra TLC come the big day. This recipe results in crisp, caramelised edges and the deliciously sticky glaze is no more demanding than a salad dressing

## Ingredients
* 1kg parsnips, peeled, trimmed and halved lengthways or quartered if chunky 
* 6 tbsp olive oil 
* 4 tbsp wholegrain mustard 
* 6 tbsp clear honey 
* 1kg carrots, trimmed and halved lengthways or quartered if chunky
* Thyme leaves, to serve

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC, gas mark 4. Tip the parsnips into a large roasting tin. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, mustard and honey. Season and pour over the parsnips, toss to coat, then roast for 15 minutes.
1. Increase the oven temperature to 220ºC, gas mark 7, then add the carrots and toss again until everything is coated. Return to the oven for 45-55 minutes until golden and tender, turning everything halfway through. Serve with a scattering of thyme leaves and pomegranate seeds, if liked.
