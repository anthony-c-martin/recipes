## Instructions
1. Crush the garlic and add to seven cups of boiling water
1. Add peas to the pot and move straight on to the next step.
1. Add your coconut milk, rice, salt, black pepper and thyme to the mix.
1. Crush the scallion (do not chop) and add this. Also add the uncut scotch bonnet pepper, nb - the pepper remains uncut so as to not make the rice spicy, just give it a subtle peppery flavour.
