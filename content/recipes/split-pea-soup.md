## Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter
* 1 medium onion, finely diced (about 6 ounces; 170g)
* 1 large rib celery, finely diced (about 4 ounces; 125g)
* 6 ounces (170g) ham steak, diced, or 1 smoked ham hock (see notes)
* 2 medium cloves garlic, minced
* 1 pound (450g) dried green split peas
* 2 quarts (2L) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock, or water
* 2 bay leaves
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion, celery, and ham (if using diced ham) and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds.
1. Add peas, chicken stock or water, and bay leaves; if using a ham hock, add it now. Stir to combine, bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, and cover, leaving lid slightly ajar. Cook until peas are tender, about 1 hour. If using a ham hock, transfer to a plate, let cool slightly, then pick meat, discarding bones.
1. If a creamier soup is desired, pulse soup using an immersion blender (or puree a portion of the peas and broth in a countertop blender before returning to soup pot), until very roughly pureed but still chunky. Return picked ham hock meat, if using, to soup. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Soup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
