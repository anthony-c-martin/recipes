## Ingredients
* 2 1/4 cups water
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 3 whole cloves
* 4 green cardamom pods, cracked open
* 4 black peppercorns
* 1/2 tsp fennel seeds (optional)
* 1/2" fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
* 3 black tea bags or sub 3 tsp loose leaf black tea
* 1 cup milk
* 4 tsp cane sugar

## Instructions
1. Heat a medium saucepan over high heat. Add water, cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, black peppercorns, fennel seeds (if using), and ginger. Bring to a boil and add the tea bags or leaves.
1. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently for 7-10 minutes, depending on how strong you’d like the tea and spices. It will turn a deep burgundy color and reduce slightly.
1. Add milk and sugar and stir. Raise the heat to high. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for another 5 minutes.
1. When ready to serve, raise the heat to high and allow it to come to a rolling boil for 1-2 minutes, depending on how 'cooked' you like the milk. If you’d like, use a ladle to aerate the chai to deepen the flavor and make it creamier.
1. Pour into cups through a strainer and add more sweetener, if desired.
