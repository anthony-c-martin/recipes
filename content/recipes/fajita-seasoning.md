## Ingredients
* 2 teaspoons chili powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional)
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Instructions
1. Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Store in an airtight container for up to 6 months.

## Notes
* Add oil or water to the spice mix to create a marinade. Add 1/4 cup canola or olive oil to the fajita seasoning then pour over steak, chicken, and onions and bell peppers. Marinade for 30 minutes before cooking.
* Add some tang to the marinade with lime or cilantro. Bump up the flavor with the juice of one lime, or 1/4 cup chopped cilantro.
* Keep meats extra tender by adding 1 tablespoon cornstarch to the wet marinade. Cornstarch in the marinade makes a slurry with the juices of the meat, keeping the moisture in the meat and extra juicy.
* Or, skip the oil or water and use as a dry seasoning. Even as a dry seasoning sprinkled directly on meats, this spice combination adds lots of flavor.
