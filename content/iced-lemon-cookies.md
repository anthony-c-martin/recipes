## Ingredients

### Cookies

- 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 2/3 cup granulated sugar
- 3 egg yolks (from large eggs)
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 1 teaspoon lemon extract
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 10 ounces (2 cups) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

### Icing

- 6 ounces (1 1/2 cups) powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon milk
- 1/4 teaspoon lemon extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.
1. Cream together the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed for 1 minute. Add the egg yolks and sour cream and mix well. Mix in the lemon extract, vanilla, and salt.
1. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Pour this into the wet mixture and mix well with the mixer until no more flour is visible. Use your hands to form the dough into a ball.
1. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to 1/2-inch thick. Use a 2-inch biscuit cutter to cut rounds from the dough. Then use the biscuit cutter to cut a crescent shape out of each circle. Form the leftover dough back into a ball, then roll it out again to cut more cookies, and repeat the process until all the dough is used up. Place the cookies on a silicone pad-lined or parchment paper-lined baking sheets.
1. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or just until light brown on the bottoms. They should be soft when cooled, and not crispy.
1. Make the icing by combining the powdered sugar, lemon juice, milk, and lemon extract in a medium bowl. Use a small frosting knife or butter knife to coat the top of each cookie with icing. Let the icing set up for about an hour before serving
